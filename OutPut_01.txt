│  You have access to two main tools:                                         │
│  1. **tavily_search**: For conducting web searches to gather information    │
│  2. **think_tool**: For reflection and strategic planning during research   │
│                                                                             │
│  **CRITICAL: Use think_tool after each search to reflect on results and     │
│  plan next steps**                                                          │

│  Think like a human researcher with limited time. Follow these steps:       │
│                                                                             │
│  1. **Read the question carefully** - What specific information does the    │
│  user need?                                                                 │
│  2. **Start with broader searches** - Use broad, comprehensive queries      │
│  first                                                                      │
│  3. **After each search, pause and assess** - Do I have enough to answer?   │
│  What's still missing?                                                      │
│  4. **Execute narrower searches as you gather information** - Fill in the   │
│  gaps                                                                       │
│  5. **Stop when you can answer confidently** - Don't keep searching for     │
│  perfection                                                                 │

│  **Tool Call Budgets** (Prevent excessive searching):                       │
│  - **Simple queries**: Use 1-2 search tool calls maximum                    │
│  - **Normal queries**: Use 2-3 search tool calls maximum                    │
│  - **Very Complex queries**: Use up to 5 search tool calls maximum          │
│  - **Always stop**: After 5 search tool calls if you cannot find the right  │
│  sources                                                                    │

│  **Stop Immediately When**:                                                 │
│  - You can answer the user's question comprehensively                       │
│  - You have 3+ relevant examples/sources for the question                   │
│  - Your last 2 searches returned similar information                        │
│  </Hard Limits>                                                             │

│  After each search tool call, use think_tool to analyze the results:        │
│  - What key information did I find?                                         │
│  - What's missing?                                                          │
│  - Do I have enough to answer the question comprehensively?                 │
│  - Should I search more or provide my answer?                               │
│  </Show Your Thinking>                                                      │

│  # TODO MANAGEMENT                                                          │
│  Based upon the user's request:                                             │
│  1. Use the write_todos tool to create TODO at the start of a user          │
│  request, per the tool description.                                         │
│  2. After you accomplish a TODO, use the read_todos to read the TODOs in    │
│  order to remind yourself of the plan.                                      │
│  3. Reflect on what you've done and the TODO.                               │
│  4. Mark you task as completed, and proceed to the next TODO.               │
│  5. Continue this process until you have completed all TODOs.               │
│                                                                             │
│  IMPORTANT: Always create a research plan in Russian of TODOs and conduct   │
│  research following the above guidelines for ANY user request.              │
│  IMPORTANT: Aim to batch research tasks into a *single TODO* in order to    │
│  minimize the number of TODOs you have to keep track of.                    │
│                                                                             │

│  # FILE SYSTEM USAGE                                                        │
│  You have access to a virtual file system to help you retain and save       │
│  context.                                                                   │
│                                                                             │
│  ## Workflow Process                                                        │
│  1. **Orient**: Use ls() to see existing files before starting work         │
│  2. **Save**: Use write_file() to store the user's request so that we can   │
│  keep it for later                                                          │
│  3. **Research**: Proceed with research. The search tool will write files.  │
│  4. **Read**: Once you are satisfied with the collected sources, read the   │
│  files and use them to answer the user's question directly.                 │
│                                                                             │
│                                                                             │

│  # SUB-AGENT DELEGATION                                                     │
│  You can delegate tasks to sub-agents.                                      │
│                                                                             │

│  Your role is to coordinate research by delegating specific research tasks  │
│  to sub-agents.                                                             │
│  </Task>                                                                    │
│                                                                             │
│  <Available Tools>                                                          │
│  1. **task(description, subagent_type)**: Delegate research tasks to        │
│  specialized sub-agents                                                     │
│     - description: Clear, specific research question or task                │
│     - subagent_type: Type of agent to use (e.g., "research-agent")          │
│  2. **think_tool(reflection)**: Reflect on the results of each delegated    │
│  task and plan next steps.                                                  │
│     - reflection: Your detailed reflection on the results of the task and   │
│  next steps.                                                                │
│                                                                             │
│  **PARALLEL RESEARCH**: When you identify multiple independent research     │
│  directions, make multiple **task** tool calls in a single response to      │
│  enable parallel execution. Use at most 3 parallel agents per iteration.    │
│  </Available Tools>                                                         │

│  **Task Delegation Budgets** (Prevent excessive delegation):                │
│  - **Bias towards focused research** - Use single agent for simple          │
│  questions, multiple only when clearly beneficial or when you have          │
│  multiple independent research directions based on the user's request.      │
│  - **Stop when adequate** - Don't over-research; stop when you have         │
│  sufficient information                                                     │
│  - **Limit iterations** - Stop after 3 task delegations if you haven't      │
│  found adequate sources                                                     │
│  </Hard Limits>                                                             │
│                                                                             │
│  <Scaling Rules>                                                            │
│  **Simple fact-finding, lists, and rankings** can use a single sub-agent:   │
│  - *Example*: "List the top 10 coffee shops in San Francisco" → Use 1       │
│  sub-agent, store in `findings_coffee_shops.md`                             │
│                                                                             │
│  **Comparisons** can use a sub-agent for each element of the comparison:    │
│  - *Example*: "Compare OpenAI vs. Anthropic vs. DeepMind approaches to AI   │
│  safety" → Use 3 sub-agents                                                 │
│  - Store findings in separate files: `findings_openai_safety.md`,           │
│  `findings_anthropic_safety.md`, `findings_deepmind_safety.md`              │
│                                                                             │
│  **Multi-faceted research** can use parallel agents for different aspects:  │
│  - *Example*: "Research renewable energy: costs, environmental impact, and  │
│  adoption rates" → Use 3 sub-agents                                         │
│  - Organize findings by aspect in separate files                            │
│                                                                             │
│  **Important Reminders:**                                                   │
│  - Each **task** call creates a dedicated research agent with isolated      │
│  context                                                                    │
│  - Sub-agents can't see each other's work - provide complete standalone     │
│  instructions                                                               │
│  - Use clear, specific language - avoid acronyms or abbreviations in task   │
│  descriptions                                                               │

│ Okay, the user wants a detailed overview of AI Deep Agents in Russian. Let  │
│ me start by understanding what exactly they need. "AI Deep Agents" likely   │
│ refers to advanced AI systems that use deep learning techniques, possibly   │
│ including reinforcement learning agents or deep reinforcement learning      │
│ models.                                                                     │
│                                                                             │
│ First, I should break down the query into manageable parts. The user might  │
│ be looking for an explanation of what deep agents are, their architecture,  │
│ applications, advantages, challenges, and maybe some examples. Since they   │
│ specified Russian, I need to ensure all the information is presented in     │
│ that language.                                                              │
│                                                                             │
│ I need to check if there are existing files in the virtual filesystem that  │
│ might already have relevant information. Using the 'ls' function would help │
│ me see what's available. If there are no files, I'll have to generate new   │
│ ones.                                                                       │
│                                                                             │
│ Next, I should consider delegating tasks to sub-agents. The user's request  │
│ is broad, so splitting it into specific research areas might be efficient.  │
│ For example, researching the definition and architecture of deep agents,    │
│ their applications in various fields, case studies or examples, challenges  │
│ in development, and future trends. Each of these can be a separate task for │
│ a sub-agent.                                                                │
│                                                                             │
│ Wait, the user mentioned "deep agents," which could also relate to agents   │
│ that use deep neural networks for decision-making, like in robotics or game │
│ playing. Maybe including topics like reinforcement learning, neural         │
│ networks, and specific use cases would be important.                        │
│                                                                             │
│ I should also think about the structure of the final overview. It should    │
│ have an introduction, sections on key concepts, applications, technical     │
│ aspects, challenges, and a conclusion. Ensuring that each section is        │
│ well-researched and cites relevant sources would add depth.                 │
│                                                                             │
│ Since the user wants a detailed overview, I need to gather comprehensive    │
│ information. Using the 'tavily_search' function for each sub-task would     │
│ help collect data from reliable sources. However, I have to be careful not  │
│ to overload with too many tasks, adhering to the hard limits mentioned.     │
│                                                                             │
│ After collecting the information, I'll need to compile it into a coherent   │
│ document. Using the 'write_file' function to save each section and then     │
│ combining them into a single overview. Also, using 'read_file' to check the │
│ content before finalizing.                                                  │
│                                                                             │
│ I should also remember to use the 'write_todos' function to create a task   │
│ list, tracking each step from research to compilation. This ensures that I  │
│ don't miss any part of the process and can efficiently manage the workflow. │
│                                                                             │
│ Finally, after gathering all the necessary information and structuring it,  │
│ I'll present the detailed overview in Russian, making sure it's clear,      │
│ accurate, and covers all the key points the user might be interested in.    │

│ The user specified Russian, so all the information needs to be in that      │
│ language. Now, looking at the tools available, I can use the                │
│ 'tavily_search' function to gather information. But the user has already    │
│ created a TODO list with four tasks. My job is to manage these tasks using  │
│ the provided functions.                                                     │

│ First, I should check the current state of the virtual file system. Using   │
│ the 'ls' function would show existing files. If there are none, I need to   │
│ start creating them. The user's TODO list has four tasks, so I should       │
│ handle each one step by step.                                               │

│ The first task is to collect information about Deep Agents. I'll use the    │
│ 'tavily_search' function with a query in Russian to get relevant sources.   │
│ Then, the second task is to analyze key architectures and algorithms.       │
│ Again, a search query in Russian would help find academic papers or         │
│ articles on this topic.                                                     │

│ The third task is to gather real-world applications. I need to search for   │
│ case studies or examples where Deep Agents have been implemented. The       │
│ fourth task is to describe advantages and limitations. This might involve   │
│ looking for comparative analyses or recent studies discussing these         │
│ aspects.                                                                    │

│ I should also use the 'write_todos' function to update the TODO list as     │
│ tasks are completed. After each search, I'll need to check the results,     │
│ maybe use 'read_file' to review the content, and then proceed to the next   │
│ task. It's important to structure each part of the overview methodically to │
│ ensure comprehensiveness.                                                   │

│ Wait, the user's initial response already has a TODO list. I need to make   │
│ sure I follow the steps outlined: use 'write_todos' to create the list,     │
│ then proceed to each task, perform searches, and update the list as tasks   │
│ are completed. Also, I should remember to use the 'think_tool' for          │
